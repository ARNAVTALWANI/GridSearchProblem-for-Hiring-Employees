# GridSearchProblem-for-Hiring-Employees

Designed three machine learning search algorithms (Breadth First Search, Bidirectional Search, and A* Search) to determine the "shortest path" between two users of a recruitment social network platform to connect them so that employers and recruiters can find the best fit prospective hires (similar to LinkedIn) and tested them based on real-world Facebook data from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection.
